# CertifAI-Deep-Learning-in-Computer-Vision
tldr: place where I can throw in all the notes and things that I gather on Machine Learning! 

Short introduction:
- This repository was inspired by a fellow GitHub-er (@mbadry1) who created his own notes for the Machine Learning course by Stanford! Brilliant!
- Back in January, I attended a 30-day training program conducted by Skymind-CertifAI where I was taught basic machine learning concepts to complex deep learning problems in computer vision. There were fully funded and I was lucky because boy I am never leaving the AI field. #newprofoundlove
- Throughout the entire program, I wrote some online notes which I jot down during the lectures or through some (LOTS) of reading via medium articles, journals, video-watching (statsquest bam!) and the courses that are available on youtube (Stanford/Coursera/MIT). It is accessible at this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieZhUQqbngxEXA_acyPvqJDCuM_VfLfDyXiRj4kTeb4/edit

Current progress:
- Update (26/04): Current dig is the MIT course by the late Prof. Winston (sad to hear that he passed away)...thinking of ways to jot my notes here
